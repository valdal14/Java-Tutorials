/**
 * MULTITHREADING in JAVA --------------------
 *
 * -> To implement Multithreading in Java there are a couple of ways
 *      -> Extend the Thread class
 *      -> Implement the Runnable Interface
 *
 * -> EXTEND THREAD CLASS
 * -> If we extend the Thread class we must override the run() method
 * -> To spawn a new thread we have to call the start() method that internally will call the run() method
 * -> We can use the static method Thread.sleep() to pause the execution
 *      -> Thread.sleep() throws a Exceptions or CHECKED exception and therefore we have to handle it at
 *          compile time
